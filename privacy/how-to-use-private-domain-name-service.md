# Take these steps now, and start reclaiming your privacy online.

## Use a private Domain Name Service (DNS)

All internet users utilise a Domain Name Service (DNS) in order to use the internet via a web browser.  The DNS service translates the address you type into the address bar (or any link you click) from "www.duckduckgo.com" to an Internet Protocol (IP) address.  Your device then uses the IP address to retrieve the website from the server(s) that are hosting it.

Your Internet Service Provider will set a default DNS, which may be a DNS they provide themselves or a 3rd party service (like Google's DNS - 8.8.8.8).

It's important to use a private DNS, because the provider of your DNS will have a insight into every web site / domain that you connect to.

Many ISP's are now looking to enter the advertising game and utilise customer data for these purposes, so it's advisable to use an alternative from your ISP's DNS.  Google provides a free DNS service, but as Google is a for profit company that makes it's money through tracking and data collection, it's unadvisable to use their free service.

Thankfully, there are a number of free, privacy focused, DNS options.

## How to switch to your DNS:

You can change your DNS in a number of places.  Each device (computer, phone, etc) will likely have a DNS setting, and in additional your router/modem will set a DNS.  It's suggested that you change the DNS on all your devices (including your modem/router).
