<div class="verse">
<p>I'll send you a message, it's not getting through</p>
<p>Can't recall if I left it, but they know if I meant it</p>

<p>Who am I?</p>
<p>Who am I, to be trusted</p>

<p>There's a lot of bad apples, who am I to complain</p>
<p>But from all these bad apples, can you keep me safe?</p>
</div>

<div class="chorus">
<p>Can't keep a secret</p>
<p>Anyway, anywhere, anyhow</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p>You hold the power, the pleasures all mine</p>
<p>Write rules with a pen, on a whim, when you want</p>

<p>We protest</p>
<p>We protest, our whole lives</p>

<p>Requests to amend, you faults and your lies</p>
<p>Request to be heard, with no compromise</p>
</div>

<div class="chorus">
<p>Can't keep a secret</p>
<p>Anyway, anywhere, anyhow</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p>You maintain a private life, so did I</p>
<p>But you're creeping on in, and I stand deprived</p>

<p>Nothing to hide</p>
<p>Nothing to hide, that's a fool's cry</p>

<p>Did you know Jessica? No, she no friend of mine</p>
<p>But I see you crossed paths, you're guilty, get in line</p>
</div>

<div class="chorus">
<p>Can't keep a secret</p>
<p>Anyway, anywhere, anyhow</p>
</div>
